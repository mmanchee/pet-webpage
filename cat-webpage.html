  <h1>My Pet Page</h1>
  <h2>I don't have a pet right now so this is a history</h2>
  <p>This page is a history on all the pets I have had in the past. From my earliest cat at 2 years until my most recent at 36</p>



<p>For the past 7 years I have lived in apartments that do not allow pets, and that is ok with me. I am good with enjoying other peopled pets right now.</p>
