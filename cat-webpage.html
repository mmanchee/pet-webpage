  <h1>My Pet Page</h1>
  <h2>I don't have a pet right now so this is a history</h2>
  <p>This page is a history on all the pets I have had in the past. From my earliest cat at 2 years until my most recent at 36</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Mystry cat (age 2)</li>
    <li>Fish in a tank (age 4)</li>
    <li>Hurby: Guinea Pig (age 6-13)</li>
      <p>Greatest moments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Got him for my birthday</li>
        <li>Won first place at a 4H pet contest</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Frisby: Lhasa Apso (age 5-7)</li>
    <li>Felix: Mixed cat (age 11-16)</li>
    <li>Kitty: Mixed cat (age 27-36)</li>
  </ol>

<p>For the past 7 years I have lived in apartments that do not allow pets, and that is ok with me. I am good with enjoying other peopled pets right now.</p>
